# About
* Inspired by https://fountain.io and Markdown

## Goals
1. Don't look like markup (like Fountain and Markdown, unlike LaTeX) - be printable as-is
2. Must support Devanagari
3. Design syntax to be forgiving of the writer's errors
   * scripts can be long and subtle errors can be difficult to spot
4. Minimize user effort and editing software requirements

## Advantages
1. Can be read, edited, and written by non-technical users
2. No special editor required
3. Intended to support keywords in all languages (unlike Fountain)
4. Don't need to specify language in multi-script texts (dammit, LaTeX/XeLaTeX üôÑ)

## Disadvantages
1. Can't define character name once to easily update all uses of it (unlike LaTeX+Thalie)
2. Not user-extensible (unlike LaTeX+Thalie)
3. no-syntax markup + m17n for keywords = more complexity for the compiler (unlike Fountain)

## Notes
* Line breaks preserved (like Fountain, unlike Markdown)
* Soft-wrapping recommended.
* Parenthesis for stage directions may conflict with writers wishing to use parenthesis in dialogues...if it becomes a real problem, square brackets may be a viable alternative.

## TODO
1. Title Page, Dramatis Personae, Act, Scene, Song -  syntax for introducing these sections
   + and m17n for their keywords
   + We have some options.
     1. Title Page, Dramatis Personae, Premiere Cast, Outline, and "Play" are represented by level 1 headings. Act and Scene are represented by level 2 and level 3 headings respectively.

        ("Play" is a level 1 heading with the same title as the value of Title: on the Title Page. Act and Scene are only allowed as branches of that.)

        The first level 1 heading is the title page (mandatory),
        the second is the dramatis personae (mandatory?),
        the third is the premiere cast (optional),
        the fourth is the outline (optional),
        the first level 1 heading after the mandatory headings, if it has the same title as the value of "Title" on the Title Page.
        * This has the disadvantage of not allowing flexibility in the 'preamble' (the before the script itself begins)
2. Verse dramas
3. "As-is printing" vs soft-wrapping vs preserving newlines
   * Both hard-wrapping and soft-wrapping seem to require special editor support.
   * Hard-wrapped is ready to be printed; soft-wrapped is easier for reading on different screens (the classic dilemma...)
   * Could let the user decide, with the compiler being able to convert between the two.
4. Markdown has some cool ideas about reducing writer effort. Might be work looking into.
5. [x] Do we need Fountain's Dual Dialogue?
   * I see it as limited - just two simultaneous speakers?
   * It also seems unnecessary - could just write "Both:" or "The three of them:" or "Foo, Bar and Quux:" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ

# Syntax
## Document structure
### Headings
Markdown's ATX headings. A line starting with one to seven # characters, followed by one or more whitespace characters, followed by at least one alphanumeric character, is a heading.
```
# a heading
## another heading
```

### Title page
An optional title page can be started by the title, which is written using Markdown's setext-style level 1 heading.
```Latin
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST
===============================

A Trivial Comedy for Serious People

Playwright: Oscar Wilde
Key: Value
Key with spaces: Value with spaces
```
Compilers could center everything on the title page (starting from title to the next heading)

### Dramatis personae
A level 1 heading with either the "Dramatis personae" keyword -
`# Dramatis personae`

Or the keyword followed by a colon and the actual heading you want - `# Dramatis personae: The persons of the play`

Comments
1. Not all works use the term "dramatis personae"
2. If we assume that the first ATX heading in a file is the dramatis personae, we lose flexibility.

#### Characters
1. If there are `[square brackets]`, the text in the left-most pair is the character name
2. Failing that, if there are `CONSECUTIVE UPPERCASE WORDS`, the left-most set is the character name
3. Failing that, if there is a comma or parenthesis, the text before the left-most comma or opening parenthesis is the character name
4. Failing that, there is no character name; the whole line is the the character _description_

The character name is emphasized to stand out from the description.

```Latin
ALOK SHARMA, a boy studying in class 11
His late GRANDFATHER
A WASHERWOMAN
```

```Devanagari
‡§Ü‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ, ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ó‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§õ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞

[‡§™‡•ú‡•ã‡§∏‡§® ‡•ß]
[‡§™‡•ú‡•ã‡§∏‡§® ‡•®]
```

You may want to use square brackets everywhere, then, for consistency...

```

Comments
1. Notable special cases
   1. In Devanagari, differentiating between a line containing only a character name (e.g. "‡§ß‡•ã‡§¨‡§®") and a line containing only a description, with no name requiring emphasis (e.g. "‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ñ‡§≤‡§§‡•á ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á").

      In Latin, it's resolved with capitals, e.g.
      ```Latin
      CAPTAIN HORSTER
      Men of various conditions and occupations, a few women, and a troop of schoolboys--the audience at a public meeting.
      ```

   2. The character name coming at the end of the line, e.g. "His late GRANDFATHER", or "‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•Ä _‡§¶‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§ú‡•Ä_".
2. For some reason, I don't like the look of square brackets for this purpose. Can we replace them with, say, emphasis markup?
   ```Devanagari
   ‡§Ü‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ, ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ó‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§õ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞
   ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡•Ä _‡§¶‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§ú‡•Ä_
   ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ, ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å
   ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•Å‡§£ ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ, ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡§æ
   _‡§ß‡•ã‡§¨‡§®_
   _‡§™‡•ú‡•ã‡§∏‡§® ‡•ß_
   _‡§™‡•ú‡•ã‡§∏‡§® ‡•®_
   ```
   * Note that now we have to include the commas in the emphasis too, thanks to Markdown whitespace rules concerning whitespace. And fiddling with _those_ would be an even bigger tangle.
     + Only if using emphasis for character names everywhere. If you keep it to the places where the character name can't be determined automatically, it's okay.
   * A solution relying on blank lines wouldn't do, because those are useful for separating characters into groups.
   * Asterisks seem to add noise and don't really seem to emphasize (in plain text, without syntax highlighting); square brackets seem to suffer from the same problem; I'm liking underscores more, for these reasons.
   * Another issue is that now, the same syntax has different semantics in the Dramatis Personae vs the rest of the document. Inconsistencies like this make the syntax harder to learn.
3. What if characters are list items, character groups are sub-lists, and the branch point of sub-lists is the character group name?

   That would allow arbitrary text in the Dramatis Personae, which is often used to note the setting of the play. See the last paragraph in this example -

   ```Latin
   * KING DUSHYANTA.
   * BHARATA, nicknamed All-tamer, his son.
   * MADHAVYA, a clown, his companion.
   * His charioteer.
   * RAIVATAKA, a door-keeper.
   * BHADRASENA, a general.
   * KARABHAKA, a servant.
   * PARVATAYANA, a chamberlain.
   * SOMARATA, a chaplain.

   * KANVA, hermit-father.
   * His pupils
     + SHARNGARAVA
     + SHARADVATA
     + HARITA
   * DURVASAS, an irascible sage.
   * The chief of police.
   * Policemen
     + SUCHAKA
     + JANUKA

   * A fisherman.
   * SHAKUNTALA, foster-child of Kanva.
   * Her friends
     + ANUSUVA
     + PRIYAMVADA

   * GAUTAMI, hermit-mother.
   * KASHYAPA, father of the gods.
   * ADITI, mother of the gods.
   * MATALI, charioteer of heaven's king.
   * GALAVA, a pupil in heaven.
   * MISHRAKESHI, a heavenly nymph.

   * Stage-director and actress (in the prologue), hermits and hermit-women, two court poets, palace attendants, invisible fairies.

   The first four acts pass in Kanva's forest hermitage; acts five and six in the king's palace; act seven on a heavenly mountain. The time is perhaps seven years.
   ```
#### Character groups
Character groups in a dramatis personae are started with a blank line, the group name, a new line, and the member characters of the group as a (Markdown) list of character names.

Blank lines between the list items can be used to group them further.

An example -
```Latin
Characters on TV
* Husband
* Wife
* Son

* News anchor
* News reporter
```
### Premiere cast (optional)
Actor: character 1, character 2

### Outline (optional)
### Body - the script itself
### Sections
Act, Scene

## Dialogues
There are two styles -
1. All caps - a blank line, followed by the character name in all-caps, followed by a new line, and the dialogue.

   ```Latin
   BILLING
   Hovstad, don't you think the town ought to give Dr. Stockmann some sort of testimonial?

   HOVSTAD
   I will suggest it, anyway.

   BILLING
   And I will speak to Aslaksen about it.

   DR. STOCKMANN
   No, my good friends, don't let us have any of that nonsense. I won't hear anything of the kind. And if the Baths Committee should think of voting me an increase of salary, I will not accept it. Do you hear, Katherine?‚ÄîI won't accept it.

   MRS. STOCKMANN
   You are quite right, Thomas.
   ```
2. Colon - a blank line, followed by the character name ending with a colon, followed by a new line, and the dialogue. Making the character name all-caps is optional, but improves legibility.
   ```Latin
   BILLING:
   Hovstad, don't you think the town ought to give Dr. Stockmann some sort of testimonial?

   HOVSTAD:
   I will suggest it, anyway.

   BILLING:
   And I will speak to Aslaksen about it.

   DR. STOCKMANN:
   No, my good friends, don't let us have any of that nonsense. I won't hear anything of the kind. And if the Baths Committee should think of voting me an increase of salary, I will not accept it. Do you hear, Katherine?‚ÄîI won't accept it.

   MRS. STOCKMANN:
   You are quite right, Thomas.
   ```
There are no capitals in Devanagari, so you must use the colon style.

### Multi-line dialogues
Once a character has been specified, we want it to apply to all following lines, until the next character is specified. In most cases, I expect this to work. An example -

```
KING (listening)
I think I hear some one to the right of the grove. I must find out. (He walks and looks about.) Ah, here are hermit-girls, with watering-pots just big enough for them to handle. They are coming in this direction to water the young trees. They are charming!

  The city maids, for all their pains,
    Seem not so sweet and good;
  Our garden blossoms yield to these
    Flower-children of the wood.

I will draw back into the shade and wait for them. (He stands, gazing toward them. Enter SHAKUNTALA, as described, and her two friends.)

FIRST FRIEND
It seems to me, dear, that Father Kanva cares more for the hermitage trees than he does for you. You are delicate as a jasmine blossom, yet he tells you to fill the trenches about the trees.
```

But what if a character's dialogue happens to coincide with the syntax of a character name?
* A hacky workaround could be to start that dialogue with a single space.
* For the colon syntax, ensure that the line ends with a colon? That would cut down on collisons...
  + But still not eliminate them entirely ü§î
* A word limit for character names could be used as a last resort.

## Stage directions
Anything in parenthesis is displayed as stage directions.
### After the character name
```Latin
PETRA (lifting her glass)
Your health, father!
```
If using a colon, it comes last -
```Latin
PETRA (lifting her glass):
Your health, father!
```
### In the dialogue
```Latin
PETER STOCKMANN
I happened to be passing, and so‚Äî(looks into the dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.
```
```Devanagari

```
### Freestanding
```Latin
(SCENE.‚ÄîDR. STOCKMANN'S sitting-room. It is evening. The room is plainly but neatly appointed and furnished.)
```
## Verse
Indent lines with two or more spaces
```
  The meanest vesture glows
    On beauty that enchants:
  The lotus lovelier shows
    Amid dull water-plants;

  The moon in added splendour
    Shines for its spot of dark;
  Yet more the maiden slender
    Charms in her dress of bark.
