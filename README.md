# About
* Inspired by https://fountain.io and Markdown

## Goals
1. Don't look like markup (like Fountain and Markdown, unlike LaTeX) - printable as-is
2. Reuse existing conventions
3. Must support Devanagari
4. Design syntax to be forgiving of the writer's errors

## Advantages
1. Can be read, edited, and written by non-technical users
2. No special editor required
3. Intended to support keywords in all languages (unlike Fountain)
4. Don't need to specify language in multi-script texts (damnit, LaTeX/XeLaTeX üò†)

## Disadvantages
1. Can't define character name once to easily update all uses of it (unlike LaTeX+Thalie)
2. Not user-extensible (unlike LaTeX+Thalie)
3. no-syntax markup + m17n for keywords = more complexity for the compiler (unlike Fountain)

## Notes
* Line breaks preserved (like Fountain, unlike Markdown)
* Soft-wrapping recommended.
* Parenthesis for stage directions may conflict with writers wishing to use parenthesis in dialogues...if it becomes a real problem, square brackets may be a viable alternative.
* Have seen another style, which looks like this. Not a fan of the use of periods for delimiting character names, but it's an example of an alternative.
  ```
  [Enter Jack.]

  [Lane goes out.]

  Algernon.  How are you, my dear Ernest?  What brings you up to town?

  Jack.  Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as usual, I see, Algy!

  Algernon.  [Stiffly.]  I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.  Where have you been since last Thursday?
  ```

## TODO
1. Dramatis personae - differentiate between just a character name (e.g. "Captain Horster") and a description line with no character name (e.g. "Men of various conditions and occupations, a few women, and a troop of schoolboys--the audience at a public meeting.")
   * it's possible with capitals in Latin ("CAPTAIN HORSTER" is a character name, the other line doesn't have capital words, so is just a description)...
   * ...but not an option in Devanagari ü§î
2. title, dramatis personae, act, scene, song -  syntax for introducing these sections, and m17n for their keywords
3. Headings?
4. [x] Do we need Fountain's Dual Dialogue?
   * I see it as limited - just two simultaneous speakers?
   * It also seems unnecessary - could just write "Both:" or "The three of them:" or "Foo, Bar and Quux:" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ

## Tested with
1. <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Enemy_of_the_People_(Ibsen)>
2. https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/844/pg844.txt

# Syntax
## Headings
Markdown's ATX headings. A line starting with one to seven # characters, followed by one or more whitespace characters, followed by at least one alphanumeric character, is a heading.
```
# a heading
## another heading
```

## Title page (optional)
```
Key: Value
Key with spaces: Value
```
## Dramatis personae

### Characters
1. If there are `[square brackets]`, the text in the left-most pair is the character name
2. Failing that, if there are `CONSECUTIVE UPPERCASE WORDS`, the left-most set is the character name
3. Failing that, if there is a comma or parenthesis, the text before the left-most comma or opening parenthesis is the character name
4. Failing that, there is no character name; the whole line is the the character _description_

The character name is emphasized to stand out from the description.

```Latin
ALOK SHARMA, a boy studying in class 11
His late GRANDFATHER
A WASHERWOMAN
```

```Devanagari

[‡§™‡•ú‡•ã‡§∏‡§® ‡•ß]
[‡§™‡•ú‡•ã‡§∏‡§® ‡•®]
```

You may want to use square brackets everywhere, then, for consistency...
```Devanagari

```

### Character groups

## Premiere cast (optional)
Actor: character 1, character 2

## Outline (optional)
## Sections
Act, scene

## Character, dialogue
```Latin
ALOK
Leave me alone, Mom.

ALOK: Leave me alone, Mom.

ALOK:
Leave me alone, Mom.
```
No capitals in Devanagari, so you must use colons.
```Devanagari
‡§Ü‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï: ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å, ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ì‡•§
‡§Ü‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï:    ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å, ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ì‡•§

‡§Ü‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï:
‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å, ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ì‡•§
```
NB - we _could_ do without colons in Devanagari - if a line followed by a blank line is treated as a character name. But I'm not too sure about it...maybe because it doesn't visually differentiate the character name?

## Stage directions
Anything in parenthesis
### Inline
```Latin
PETER STOCKMANN
I happened to be passing, and so‚Äî(looks into the dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.
